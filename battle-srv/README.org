;; game example
;; in this case eacsh player has separate boards for  different aspects, ships, shots, etc
{
 :p1 {:name "joakim"
      :board [[0 0 0 (:ship 2 d)]
              [0 0 0 0]
              [0 0 0 0]
              [0 0 0 0]]}
 :p2 {:name "mattias"
      :board [[0 0 1 0]
              [0 0 0 0]
              [0 0 0 0]
              [0 0 0 0]]}
 }

;; another game example
;; in this case the grid is shared for both(or more) players
'
{
  {:name "joakim" :id :p1}
  {:name "mattias" :id :p2}

;; a layer approach
{
  {:name "joakim" :id :p1}
  {:name "mattias" :id :p2}

  ;;ships
  :entities {
             :p1 [[0 0 (:s 2 d) 0]
                  [0 0 0 0]

                 [0 0 0 0]]}

;;again a shared grid example
;;here im thinking that it feels like its nicer with a shared world
;; and views of the world, that might have fog of war and stuff
{
 :players {{:name "joakim" :id :p1}
           {:name "mattias" :id :p2}}

  ;; 0 should be nil
  :board [[0 0 {:type :shot :owner :p2 }  {:type :ship :owner :p1 :l 2 :dir 'd}   0 0 0 0]
          [0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0]
          [0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0]
          [0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0]

         ]


 }

;;so, is this useful for other games? heres Go
;, seems ok. :type and :owner are generic enough to be usable across games
{
 :players {{:name "joakim" :id :p1}
           {:name "mattias" :id :p2}}

  ;; 0 should be nil
 :board [[{:type 'stone :owner :p1} 0 0] 0 
         [0 0 0 0 ]
         [0 0 0 0 ]
         [0 0 0 {:type 'stone :owner :p2} ]
         ]


 }
